#Problem Statement
#
#In this challenge, the user enters a string and a substring and you have to print the number of times that substring occurs in that string. String traversal will take place from left to right, not from right to left.
#
#NOTE : Letters of string are case-sensitive.
#
#Input Format
#
#Two strings each in a new line.
#
#Constraints
#
#1 <= len(string) <= 200 
#each character in the string is an ascii character.
#
#Output Format
#
#An integer number indicating the total number of occurrences of that string.
#
#Sample Input
#
#ABCDCDC
#CDC
#Sample Output
#
#2
#Concept
#
#Some string processing examples such as these might be useful. 
#There are a couple of new concepts : 
#In python, length of a string is found out by the function len(s), where s is the string. 
#To traverse through the length of a string, use for loop :
#
#for i in range(0, len(s)):
#    print (s[i])
#Range function is used to loop over some length, eg :
#
#range (0, 5)
#-> loops over 0 to 4(5 excluded)
