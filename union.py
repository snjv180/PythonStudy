#Problem Statement
#
#AuB.png.union()
#
#.union() operator returns the union of set and the set of elements in an iterable. 
#Sometimes '|' operator is used in place of .union() operator but it operates only on the set of elements in set.
#Set is immutable to .union() operation (or '|' operation).
#
#Example
#
#>>> s = set("Hacker")
#>>> print s.union("Rank")
#set(['a', 'R', 'c', 'r', 'e', 'H', 'k', 'n'])
#
#>>> print s.union(set(['R', 'a', 'n', 'k']))
#set(['a', 'R', 'c', 'r', 'e', 'H', 'k', 'n'])
#
#>>> print s.union(['R', 'a', 'n', 'k'])
#set(['a', 'R', 'c', 'r', 'e', 'H', 'k', 'n'])
#
#>>> print s.union(enumerate(['R', 'a', 'n', 'k']))
#set(['a', 'c', 'r', 'e', (1, 'a'), (2, 'n'), 'H', 'k', (3, 'k'), (0, 'R')])
#
#>>> print s.union({"Rank":1})
#set(['a', 'c', 'r', 'e', 'H', 'k', 'Rank'])
#
#>>> s | set("Rank")
#set(['a', 'R', 'c', 'r', 'e', 'H', 'k', 'n'])
