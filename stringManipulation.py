#Problem Statement
#
#We have seen that lists are mutable (you can make changes) and tuples on the other hand are immutable (you can't make changes).
#
#Let's try to understand this with an example.
#
#You are given a string(immutable) and you want to make changes in it.
#
#Example
#
#>>> string = "abracadabra"
#You can access an index as
#
#>>> print string[5]
#a
#What if you would like to assign a value?
#
#>>> string[5] = 'k' 
#Traceback (most recent call last):
#  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
#TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment
#How would you approach this?
#
#One solution is to convert the string to a list and then change the value.
#Example
#
#>>> string = "abracadabra"
#>>> l = list(string)
#>>> l[5] = 'k'
#>>> string = ''.join(l)
#>>> print string
#abrackdabra
#Another approach is to slice the string and join it back.
#Example
#
#>>> string = string[:5] + "k" + string[6:]
#>>> print string
#abrackdabra
#Task 
#You have to read a string. change the character at a given index and print the string.
#
#Input Format 
#First line contains a string, S. 
#Next line contains an integer i and a character c.
#
#Output Format 
#Using any of the method explained above. Replace the character at index i with c.
#
#Sample Input
#
#abracadabra
#5 k
#Sample Output
#
#abrackdabra

string = input()
pos, char = input().split()
string = string[:int(pos)]+char+string[int(pos)+1:]
print(string)
